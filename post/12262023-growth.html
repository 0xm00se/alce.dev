                    It has taken quite some time to get here. While this a poor man's lab. It has seen a lot of growth and still has some more to do, as well as I. This is an ongoing project, I figure it will take my life (not literally, but like I'll be doing this as long as I breathe). I'm currently working on improving my programming skills. Currently focusing on C++ as part of my degree program and other misc stuff. This is all mostly managed with an ansible playbook.

                    The Lab below is comprised of four proxmox instances, a Truenas node, and a Fedora server used mainly for playing around as I gear towards RHEL certs. There is also a Jupyter server with a couple of kernels, just for random fun and testing.
