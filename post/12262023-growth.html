                    I've been working on a lot of things lately. One of my main focuses lately was finishing this past semester on a great note. I'm happy to say that I did. The goal of the current break was to sharpen certain skills I'm interested in, skills such as C++ programming and Linux administration. The Linux administration course has been great, from learning Ansible to working with multiple VMs and my dive into chron jobs. As my interest has grown, I have decided to work toward the RHCSA certification, while also undertaking another programming project to further my understanding of these technologies.

                    This year has been incredibly successful for me. My focus has been on my education and my health. My growth has been exponential, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.
