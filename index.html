                            I've been working on a lot of things lately. One of my main focuses lately was finishing this past semester on a great note. I'm happy to say that I did. The goal of the current break was to sharpen certain skills I'm interested in, skills such as C++ programming and Linux administration. The Linux administration course has been great, from learning Ansible to working with multiple VMs and my dive into chron jobs. As my interest has grown, I have decided to work toward the RHCSA certification, while also undertaking another programming project to further my understanding of these technologies.

                            I'm facing a somewhat difficult point in life. Should I chase that which will set me free on the road towards what I want, Or simply just follow the road built by others before me?

                            It has taken quite some time to get here. While this a poor man's lab. It has seen a lot of growth and still has some more to do, as well as I. This is an ongoing project, I figure it will take my life (not literally, but like I'll be doing this as long as I breathe). I'm currently working on improving my programming skills. Currently focusing on C++ as part of my degree program and other misc stuff. This is all mostly managed with an ansible playbook.
